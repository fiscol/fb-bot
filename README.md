## API Development Steps：
1. Go to routes/functional.js, set up the new API URL path in the related functional area.
2. Go to functional folder, add a new functional sub folder with Service and Model folder/files.
3. Check input parameters in the Service.js and add comments about the function.
4. Go to Model.js, implement private methods.
5. If there's any Firebase related call, include functions from db/firebase_db.js.
6. Handle 3rd party and Database related sync calls: Use then, catch and promise ways to implement the dataflow.

We use npm tools like [Request-Promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise)、[Request](https://github.com/request/request)、[Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q)、[Step](https://github.com/creationix/step) to help with sync calls:

We use the npm [FB](https://github.com/node-facebook/facebook-node-sdk) to call Facebook Graph API and deal with Facebook login authentication.

[Node-Schedule](https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule) is the npm tool we use, to do the scheduled setting with records in our Firebase Database.
